# React Components Practice

## About

This repository contains a collection of React components that I've created for practice and learning purposes. Each component serves a specific function or demonstrates a particular concept within React development.

### Components

1. **Stepper Component**: A versatile stepper component that allows users to navigate through a series of steps. It includes progress tracking and dynamic step completion indicators.

2. **Card Component**: A reusable card component for displaying user data fetched from an API. It includes features like image display, name, gender, and contact information.

3. **Footer Component**: A simple footer component created using Tailwind CSS, providing a basic layout for website footers.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills and understanding of React development. I've built these components to reinforce my knowledge of React concepts such as state management, component composition, and data fetching.

### How to Use

Each component is contained within its own directory and includes a README.md file with instructions on how to use it in your own projects. Simply clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in each component's README.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions for improvements, bug fixes, or new components to add, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
